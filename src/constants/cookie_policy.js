<h1>Dispute Resolution</h1>

<p>
Under and in compliance with Law No. 144/2015, of 08.09, Banana Frog 3D provides the necessary information for the consumer client to exercise their right to complain to an official, third-party, impartial entity that will help resolve the dispute in question. Alternative dispute resolution is the option that all consumers have to seek assistance from official entities to resolve or guide them in a conflict before initiating legal proceedings in court.
</p>

<p>
Generally, the procedure can be described as follows:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>The consumer client requests an impartial third party to act as an intermediary between themselves and the supplier or service provider that is the subject of their complaint.</l1>
    <li>The intermediary may suggest a solution to the complaint, impose a solution on both parties, or bring the parties together to find a solution.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Alternative dispute resolution can take the form of "mediation," "conciliation," or "arbitration." It is usually less costly, less formal, and quicker than judicial proceedings.
</p>

<p>
In case of a dispute, the consumer client can contact an Alternative Dispute Resolution entity:
