      <h2 className={styles.heading2}>Cookies We May Use and Why</h2>
      <p className={`${styles.paragraph}`}>
        When we use cookies on our website, we may place them into one of the
        following categories:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li className={`${styles.paragraph}`}>
          - Strictly Necessary Cookies: These are essential for the website to
          function and cannot be turned off in our systems. They are usually set
          in response to actions you have taken, such as setting your privacy
          preferences, logging in, or filling out forms.
        </li>
        <li className={`${styles.paragraph}`}>
          - Analytics and Performance Cookies: These allow us to count visits
          and traffic sources so we can measure and improve our website's
          performance. They may be set by us or by third parties to help us

        </li>
        <li className={`${styles.paragraph}`}>
          - Advertising and Targeting Cookies: These may be set on our website

      <h2 className={styles.heading2}>
        How Long Do Cookies Stay on My Device?
      </h2>
      <p className={`${styles.paragraph}`}>
        The duration that cookies remain on your device depends on whether they
        are "persistent" cookies or "session" cookies. A persistent cookie is
        stored on a web browser and remains valid until its expiry date, unless
        deleted before that date. On the other hand, a session cookie is deleted
        at the end of your web session when the web browser is closed.
      </p>

      <h2 className={styles.heading2}>How to Control Cookies?</h2>
      <p className={`${styles.paragraph}`}>

      <h2 className={styles.heading2}>Email Communications</h2>
      <p className={`${styles.paragraph}`}>
        We may also use monitoring technologies to determine if our visitors
        have read, clicked on links, or forwarded certain communications sent by
        us via email, with the aim of assessing the relevance of our

      <h2 className={styles.heading2}>Dispute Resolution</h2>
      <p className={`${styles.paragraph}`}>
        Under and in compliance with Law No. 144/2015, of 08.09, Banana Frog 3D
        provides the necessary information for the consumer client to exercise
        their right to complain to an official, third-party, impartial entity
        that will help resolve the dispute in question. Alternative dispute
        resolution is the option that all consumers have to seek assistance from
        official entities to resolve or guide them in a conflict before
        initiating legal proceedings in court.
      </p>
      <p className={`${styles.paragraph}`}>
        Generally, the procedure can be described as follows:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li className={`${styles.paragraph}`}>
          - The consumer client requests an impartial third party to act as an
          intermediary between themselves and the supplier or service provider
          that is the subject of their complaint.
        </li>
        <li className={`${styles.paragraph}`}>
          - The intermediary may suggest a solution to the complaint, impose a
          solution on both parties, or bring the parties together to find a
          solution.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p className={`${styles.paragraph}`}>
        Alternative dispute resolution can take the form of "mediation,"
        "conciliation," or "arbitration." It is usually less costly, less
        formal, and quicker than judicial proceedings. In case of a dispute, the
        consumer client can contact an Alternative Dispute Resolution entity:
